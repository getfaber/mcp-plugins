# Faber plugins for Claude and Codex

Faber turns useful AI-assisted work into durable, private artifacts that your
team can find and reuse later.

This repository contains three Faber plugins:

- `faber-claude-code` bundles the native Faber companion, lifecycle hooks,
  knowledge capture, encrypted offline queueing, and hosted Faber access.
- `faber-cowork` adds Faber publishing and knowledge recall to Claude Cowork.
- `faber-codex` adds the Faber companion, local file publishing, encrypted
  offline queueing, and hosted Faber access to Codex CLI and Codex Desktop.

## Install on Claude Code

Add the Faber marketplace and install the Claude Code plugin:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add getfaber/mcp-plugins
claude plugin install faber-claude-code@faber-mcp-plugins
```

Faber for Claude Code supports macOS and Linux on Intel/AMD and Arm processors.

To update Faber for Claude Code, refresh the marketplace and update the plugin:

## Install on Codex

Reinstalling refreshes the cached plugin while preserving your Faber
connection, queued work, and plugin data.

## Connect to Faber

The first time you use Faber, your AI client opens a browser so you can sign in and
authorize access to your Faber account. You do not need to create or paste an
API key.

Each client maintains its own secure connection, but all can use the same Faber
account and workspace. Normal plugin updates preserve your connection and
queued work.

## What you can do

- Publish polished reports and reusable work as private Faber artifacts.
- Find relevant knowledge from artifacts you have permission to view.
- Build on earlier work while preserving its source and version lineage.
- Share durable results across Claude Code, Cowork, and the rest of your team.
