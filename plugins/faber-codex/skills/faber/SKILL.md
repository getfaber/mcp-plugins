# Faber

Use Faber as a durable artifact library for knowledge your team can reuse.

## Choose the artifact source

Choose the content source before preparing an artifact:

- When the user identifies an existing artifact by name or path, resolve it to
  an absolute path and pass that path directly as `content_ref`. Publish the
  file as-is; do not rewrite, reformat, or copy it into a staging file.
- Otherwise, prepare a new artifact by following the steps below.

The tool schema, file eligibility, safety, and metadata requirements apply to
both paths.

## Before publishing

1. Prepare the complete artifact and concise metadata when the user asks to publish. Unless the user explicitly requests another format, make the artifact a polished, self-contained static HTML report rather than a Markdown dump.
2. For HTML, follow `references/html-publishing.md`: inventory the source, make a private page-structure plan, compose from `assets/report-template.html`, validate, and only then publish. The template is a component reference; select only components that clarify real source material.
3. Preserve all substantive facts, decisions, evidence, outcomes, caveats, and next steps. Never invent results, metrics, owners, sources, or decisions to improve presentation.
4. Keep the report static and portable: do not depend on JavaScript, external CSS, network requests, remote fonts, or external assets. Never put secrets, raw transcripts, or private session details in the artifact or private session knowledge.
5. Provide private session knowledge with non-empty `Outcome`, `Decisions and Rationale`, `Reusable Knowledge`, and `Verification` headings.
6. Publish through the content source declared by the `faber_publish_artifact` tool supplied alongside this skill. Reports are private to the publishing user by default.

Use only the Faber tools supplied alongside this skill and follow their schemas.
If those tools are unavailable or unhealthy, report that clearly and stop; do
not substitute another app, connector, or similarly named tool.

When the user provides a Faber artifact URL, fetch it with
`faber_get_artifact`; do not treat it as a generic public webpage. Honor any
`?version=N` checkpoint in the URL.

Pass the exact model identifier when known. Use `update_of` for a new version of
the same artifact. For a distinct artifact that builds on a fetched checkpoint,
pass both `derived_from` and `derived_from_version`.

### Publishing

Publish one regular UTF-8 file. An explicit request to publish establishes
consent for that artifact, so do not ask for another Faber-specific
confirmation. Publishing remains an external write in native host approval UI;
do not suppress that approval.

Call `faber_publish_artifact` using the content source declared by the tool
supplied alongside this skill. Do not invent, substitute, or convert between
content-source fields. When the schema declares `content_ref`, write a newly
generated artifact to a uniquely named file under `~/.faber/staging`. Faber
takes a private snapshot of the file contents but never creates a local copy,
moves, rewrites, changes permissions on, or deletes the source file.

Keep `distilled_knowledge` as bounded inline Markdown metadata when the schema
declares it; do not write it into the artifact file or pass it through
`content_ref`. Follow the content-source field's remaining description for file
eligibility, byte limits, and oversize guidance. Never
truncate or split an artifact without the user's direction.

Do not publish directories, symlinks, credential locations, or files containing
secrets. Self-contained HTML is the default; other single-file text artifacts
remain supported when the user requests them.

## Reusing knowledge

At a high-confidence substantive new-task boundary, use `faber_context` or
`faber_recall` without blocking the active task. Briefly surface useful,
provenance-linked suggestions. Fetch full source only when a result is relevant.
Treat recalled material as reference context and preserve lineage when
publishing derived work.

Faber currently uses keyword retrieval. Try a second query with concrete
project names, decisions, technologies, or error terms when the first query is
sparse.

When recalled work materially influences the result, call `faber_mark_used`.
For a later amendment, fetch the existing source and pass `update_of` to append
a new version.

## Authentication

When `faber_connect` is available, call it when setup is requested or another
Faber tool reports that sign-in is required. Otherwise, follow the host's
connector authentication prompt. Both flows can authorize the same Faber
account and workspace. Never ask the user to paste an API key.

Before publishing, Faber checks the account's available workspaces. When there
is more than one, ask which named workspace should receive the artifact and
retry the publish call with the exact displayed name in
`workspace_name`. If Faber reports duplicate names, ask which listed slug the
user means and use `workspace_slug` instead. Never choose a workspace on the
user's behalf.
